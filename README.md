# Chess
I have attempted to code chess in python.

This is my first sizeable project. I decided to undertake this project to improve my understanding of OOP. The application works well but the readability/practice of the code is very poor.

The chess engine (chessv6) contains the logic for all piece movement but is missing (castling, en-passant and checkmate)

The chessGUI(workshop3) file contains a complete and interactive chess GUI made using the pygame package.


You will need to download and install the pygame package to your computer. This is done by entering ‘pip install pygame’ in the command prompt terminal.

To run the application execute the code in the chessGUI(workshop3) file.
