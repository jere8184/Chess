# Chess
I have attempted to code chess in python.

This is my first sizeable project. I decided to undertake this project in order to improve my understanding of OOP. The application works well but readability of the code is very poor.

The chess engine (chessv6) contains the logic for all piece movement but is missing (castling, en-passant, turn restrictions and checkmate)

The chessGUI (workshop3) contains a complete and interactive chess GUI coded in pygame.
